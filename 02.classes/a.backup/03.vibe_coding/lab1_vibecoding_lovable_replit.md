# Building a social networkplatform - (Prompt Engineering)

In this lab, youâ€™ll build a sleek, responsive social network application using Lovable/Replit, a developer assistant designed to help you scaffold high-quality apps fast. Your mission is to create an social network platform focused on connecting people, with a clean layout, and aseamless mobile experience.

By the end of this lab, you'll have a fully structured web app foundation that can be extended with real content, user auth, and backend logic â€” ready for deployment or customization.

Whether you're building a personal learning platform, an internal training tool, or a public social network, this lab gives you the perfect starting point.

Letâ€™s build something people will love to learn with. ðŸš€


## Tools:

- ðŸ”¥ [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) - Prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web and mobile apps.
- ðŸ”¥ [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) - "Idea to app in seconds. Lovable is your superhuman full stack engineer".
- ðŸ”¥ [Replit](https://replit.com/) - "Simply describe your idea above and let the Agent build it for you".

## Role/Profession  
Frontend Developer

## Project Description

### Overview  
We are building a **responsive Social network education app** designed to deliver a high-quality user experience across devices. The platform should support connecting users, watching video, and engaging with interactive activities. The tone and UX should be clean and professional like Facebook or LinkedIn, but built for speed and responsiveness.


### Tech Stack  (Optional)
- **React.js** (frontend)  
- **Vite.js** (dev server)  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **TypeScript**  
- **shadcn/ui** for UI components  

## Lab Goal.

Your goal is to craft an effective prompt that generates your desired output using an AI tool of your choice.

Follow these prompt engineering best practices:

1. Be specific â€“ Clearly define what you want the AI to do.
2. Provide examples â€“ Help guide the model by showing examples of expected input/output.
3. Define the desired outcome â€“ Explain what the final result should look like.
4. Iterate â€“ Refine your prompt based on the results until it works as intended.

Once your prompt is ready, use a tool like Lovable.dev, Replit, or any preferred platform to start building your app.
Finally, compare your results with your peers to analyze different approaches and outcomes.

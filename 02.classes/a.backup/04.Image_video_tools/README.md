# üñºÔ∏è AI Tools for Image and Video Creation

Welcome to the second session of the **AI Productivity Course**. In this class, we'll explore how AI is transforming the world of **image and video creation**. You'll learn what **Stable Diffusion** is, how generative AI works for visual media, and get hands-on with cutting-edge tools for content creation.

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand how image and video generation with AI works
- Learn what Stable Diffusion is and how it's used
- Explore the top AI tools in the market for images, design, and video
- Get inspired to incorporate visual AI into your workflow

---

## üß† What is Stable Diffusion?

**[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion)** is an open-source **text-to-image** model developed by Stability AI. It generates high-quality images from written prompts using a diffusion-based algorithm.

It‚Äôs popular because:
- It‚Äôs open and customizable
- Can run locally or in the cloud
- Supports advanced styles, fine-tuning, and model extensions (e.g., ControlNet, LoRA)

## üñåÔ∏è How Generative AI Creates Images

The process usually looks like this:

1. You enter a **prompt** (e.g. "a futuristic city at sunset in watercolor style")
2. The model interprets it using trained data and **latent diffusion**
3. An image is generated through iterative denoising
4. Optional: refine or remix using inpainting, upscaling, or filters

## ‚úçÔ∏è Prompting Tips for Image/Video

- Be **descriptive**: "A surreal dreamscape with floating islands, pastel colors, cinematic lighting"
- Add **style references**: "in the style of Studio Ghibli", "as a watercolor", "ultra-realistic"
- Use **modifiers**: camera angles, lighting, aspect ratio (e.g. "wide shot", "sunset", "4k")
- Use negative prompts (in Stable Diffusion): e.g. "no blur, no distortion"
